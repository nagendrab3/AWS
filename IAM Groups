IAM GROUPS
An IAM group is essentially a collection of IAM users. It allows you to manage multiple users at once, instead of assigning permissions individually.

Example
You might have a group called Admins and all users in this group will have administrative access to your AWS resources.

Key Concepts of IAM Groups

==> Group of IAM Users

An IAM group is essentially a collection of IAM users. It allows you to manage multiple users at once, instead of assigning permissions individually.

Example: You might have a group called Admins and all users in this group will have administrative access to your AWS resources.

==> Permissions and Policies:

IAM policies are used to define what actions are allowed or denied in AWS.
These policies are assigned to groups (or individual users) and the users in the group inherit those permissions.

Permissions in a group are determined by managed policies or inline policies that are attached to the group.

==> Simplifies User Management:

Rather than assigning permissions to each individual user, you can assign permissions to groups.
Any user added to the group will inherit the permissions associated with the group, making it easier to manage large numbers of users.

==> Types of Policies:

AWS Managed Policies: Predefined policies by AWS for common use cases (e.g., AdministratorAccess, ReadOnlyAccess).

Customer Managed Policies: Policies that you create to fine-tune permissions based on specific use cases.

Inline Policies: Policies that are directly attached to a specific group or user (less commonly used).

How IAM Groups Work

==> Creating a Group

You create a group in IAM and then assign a set of policies to it. These policies define the permissions that members of the group will have.

Example

A group named Developers might have permissions to manage EC2 instances and Lambda functions, but not delete or modify IAM roles.

A group named Admins might have full access to all AWS services and resources.

==> Assigning Users to Groups

After creating a group, you can add users to that group. Once users are added to the group, they will automatically inherit the permissions attached to that group.

==> Policy Inheritance

Users in a group inherit all of the permissions that are granted to the group. If a user is in multiple groups, they inherit the union of permissions from all those groups.

Example Use Cases:

==> Suppose you have the following roles

Admins: Full access to all AWS services.

Developers: Access to EC2, Lambda, and S3, but no access to IAM or billing.

Read-Only: Can view resources but not modify them.

==> Instead of assigning permissions to each individual user, you would

Create an Admin group with full access.

Create a Developer group with specific permissions.

Create a Read-Only group with view-only permissions.

Benefits of Using IAM Groups

==> Centralized Management:

Groups allow you to manage permissions for many users at once, reducing administrative overhead.

==> Easier Permission Control

Rather than modifying permissions for each user, you just modify the groups permissions and all users in that group will inherit those changes.

==> Scalable Security

As your organization grows, IAM groups make it easier to manage access control across many users, ensuring that your security model is maintainable.

IAM Groups Creation

Step 1: Open the IAM Console

==> Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

==> Navigate to Services > Security Identity & Compliance > IAM.

==> In the left pane, select User groups.

==> Click on the Create group button.

==> In the Group name field, give your group a name (e.g., Admins, Developers, Viewers, etc.).

==> Assign Permissions

==> Under Attach permissions, you can either

Choose Managed Policies: AWS provides predefined permissions (policies). For example, you can select policies like AdministratorAccess, AmazonEC2FullAccess, or ReadOnlyAccess.

Create a Custom Policy: If you want more granular control, you can create your own custom policies or attach inline policies to the group.

==> To select policies

Type in the policy name (e.g., AdministratorAccess), and select the checkbox next to it.

==> Review and Create

After assigning the policies, click Next.

Review the details and click Create group.

Add Users to the IAM Group

==> Add Users to the Group:

After creating the group, you can add users to the group by selecting the group name under User groups.

Click Add users.

Select existing users (or create new users) that you want to add to this group.

Click Add users to add them to the group.

Attach Policies to IAM Group

==> Attach Managed Policies:

After creating a group, you can always go back to User groups in IAM.

Select your group, and you can click on Permissions to attach new managed policies.

==> Attach Inline Policies (optional):

To create more customized permissions, you can create inline policies (policies that are directly attached to the group).

Click on the Add inline policy button in the Permissions tab of the group.

Use the policy editor to create custom policies based on the actions you need to allow or deny.
