What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of cloud-based services such as:

==> Compute power (e.g., EC2)
==> Storage (e.g., S3)
==> Databases (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB)
==> Networking (e.g., VPC, Route 53)
==> Machine Learning, IoT, DevOps tools, and much more

AWS allows individuals, startups, and enterprises to build and scale applications without having to manage physical servers or data centers.
